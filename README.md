Refinery29 is a digital media and entertainment website that publishes "Money Diaries" a few times a week, where a reader submits their income, net worth, monthly expenses, and a diary of their spending for a week. There is no search function for money diaries, so if you were interested in only diaries from New York City or only people making less than $50,000, you would have to manually search through the hundreds of past diaries. 

I made a [shiny app](https://rpubs.com/robinson_es/967136) where anyone can search and filter for past money diaries salary, location, age, occupation, weekly spend, and monthly rent/mortgage. Information was scrapped from the Refinery29's website using rvest and then parsed with dplyr/purrr/stringr. Right now, I rerun the script manually every few weeks to get the most recent money diaries, but I am considering making the process automatic.
